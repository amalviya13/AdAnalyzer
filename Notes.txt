Image List View Changes
- Currently is simply printed out by

<Grid
  container
  spacing={3}
>
  {this.state.sets.map((set) => (
    <Grid
      item
      key={set}
      lg={4}
      md={6}
      xs={12}
    >
      <SetCard
        product={set}
      />
    </Grid>
  ))}
</Grid>

- Doesn't allow me to add a button next to each image since it is just this.state.sets.map
- Option 1: Make each image its own componenet, so the componenet can have two simple parts - Name and a Button
- Option 2: Find a way to create a button next to each of the this.state.sets.map - examples are online of this as well

- Current url for this page is /app/SpecificSet/:setName
- Could you figure out a way to get the :setName URL parameter into the API call to get rid of hardcode
- Could take a look at what I've done however it is slightly different (Dashboard/Pie.js one example)
- All those files are Typescript while this uses a react class which makes it different

I feel like option 2 is easier if you can find out how to get a URL parameter in an React Class
